# Question Answering Web Application

## A fully functional web application that answers factoid questions in arabic or english and written in Python.

This project is part of the Introduction to Natural Language Processing class at ENSIAS, Mohamed V University. When choosing the project to work on during the class, I decided to work on the realm of Question and Answering which is a subsection of NLP. At that time, ChatGPT and LLMs were trending and I was so intringued to know how these technologies work. However, these subjects were so advanced that my professor suggested to go step by step and start with the simplest "LLM" wich is a Q&A project that would give me the basics of NLP and could propulse me after into the LLM world.

Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* Create an open-domain Arabic and English question answering system using Python.
* Implement a Document Retriever using wikipedia api.
* Implement a Document Reader using both [distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad) and [AraElectra-Arabic-SQuADv2-QA](https://huggingface.co/ZeyadAhmed/AraElectra-Arabic-SQuADv2-QA) models through api calls to HuggingFace server using inference api.
* Create a Messenger like web application using Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
