# Question Answering Web Application

## A fully funcitonal web application that answers factoid questions in arabic or english and written in Python.

This project is part of the Introduction to Natural Language Processing class. I chose to work on the realm of Question and Answering which is a subsection of NLP because at that time, ChatGPT and LLMs were trending and I was so intringued to know how these technologies work. However, when I proposed the subject of LLMs as a project, my professor suggested to go step by step and start with a simple project that could propulse me after into the LLM world. So, this project is an introductory project to Q&A and more generally NLP. 

Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* Create an open-domain Arabic and English question answering system using Python.
* Implement a Document Retriever using wikipedia api.
* Implement a Document Reader using both [distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad) and [AraElectra-Arabic-SQuADv2-QA](https://huggingface.co/ZeyadAhmed/AraElectra-Arabic-SQuADv2-QA) models through api calls to HuggingFace server using inference api.
* Create a Messenger like web application using Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
